Recently, my interest in large proportions switched to Bitcoin both from financial and technical standpoint. I've been reading a lot on the topic (be it books, forums, reddit discussions, youtube videos, various conference talks etc.). One thing I noticed, and it has been noted many times by many people (and very influential ones) in Bitcoin community, is the difficulty of "getting" the Bitcoin, and understanding what it is from the standpoint of a "regular" human - Homo Domesticus .

I would like to contribute to this part of the equation, which is technically the most important one, and Bitcoins' "success" as a global currency is in a lot of things related to adoption by large quantity of people, ie. masses.

I am planning on writing a series of blog posts describing what Bitcoin is, in a way that would be easy to understand by anyone. Hopefully someone will find them helpful.
