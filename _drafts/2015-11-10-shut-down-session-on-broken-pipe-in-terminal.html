<p>So, you're connected to a server via SSH, doing your wizardry and dark magic. Suddenly, a wild Pidgey appears. Just kidding.</p>
<p>You left the SSH connection opened, and went to grab a cup of coffee, only to come back and find that you can't do anything with your terminal anymore.<br />
Oh noo.. broken pipe, again?? I need to kill this terminal and start new one, because stupid Ctrl + C nor Ctrl + D work.</p>
<p>Hold on for a second. There is no need for that kind of blasphemy. There is a simple and easy way to shut down opened session and get back to your already opened terminal.</p>
<p>How, you say?<br />
Use this key combo:<br />
<code>Enter + ~ + .</code></p>
<p>This will shut down the session and let you go back to your old terminal.</p>
<p>To see other available options try this key combo:<br />
<code>Enter + ~ + ?</code></p>
<p>Not bad, huh?</p>
<p>Cheers.</p>
