<p>One of my goals for this year was to use git (and github) as much as I could. I wanted to achieve a certain number of contributions throughout a year, 365 to be precise. And here it is.   As you can see, there is still a lot of free space in the beginning of the year, so this number will surely rise, but I just wanted to  display this here since it's my first.</p>
